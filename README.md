# number_2_word

This project looks at converting any number to it's word variant (i.e. 1 -> "one")

There are several key assumptions held in this project:
- Number cannot exceed 12-digits.
- Number can only be positive.
- Number must be an integer
- Valid inputs include ".txt" files, integer, and string of integer. 
- ".txt" file and string must contain a valid number but cannot have inside of it a non-number (e.g. "#1234" or "1,2,3,4" or "1234.")
